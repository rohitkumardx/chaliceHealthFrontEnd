                    <h3>4.1. Telemedicine</h3>
                    <p>Some of our Services may offer a telemedicine online platform, enabling participating medical professionals and healthcare staff ("Providers") to engage with their clients, customers, and/or patients (collectively, "Patients") to deliver healthcare-related services online and conduct virtual consultations via an internet connection. We do not assume responsibility for internet connectivity issues or related problems. It's important to note that we are not a medical service provider, health insurance company, or licensed to sell health insurance. Our Services are not designed for use by Providers and/or Patients for active patient monitoring that necessitates immediate clinical action or continuous surveillance.</p>

                    <p>The Providers delivering services through our platform operate as independent professionals within independently owned professional practices. We do not practice medicine or any other licensed profession, nor do we interfere with the practice of medicine or any other licensed profession by Providers. Each Provider is accountable for their services and must comply with the regulations applicable to their profession and license.</p>

                    <p>Information exchanged between Providers and/or Patients through the Services is transmitted solely via the platform and is not verified or endorsed by us. It is provided on an "as-is" basis, and we disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. We shall not be liable to you or any party, including Service users, for any decisions made or actions taken in reliance on information about Providers or Patients on the platform.</p>

                    <p>You certify that you are not a beneficiary of federal health care programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE). Providing false or deceptive information, including regarding your Medicare or Medicaid enrollment status, may result in the termination of your current or future use of the Services.</p>

                    <p>The ability of a healthcare provider to use our platform does not imply our endorsement or recommendation of that provider. We, along with any third parties promoting or linking to the Services, are not liable for any professional advice received from a Provider via the platform. The medical guidance provided by your Provider is beyond our control and is not provided by us. As a Patient, you acknowledge that your healthcare services are provided by your healthcare provider, and any services obtained from the Provider are at your own risk. You assume full responsibility for any associated risks to the extent permitted by law. By using the Service, you agree not to hold us liable for any malpractice or substandard treatment provided by the Provider.</p>

                    <p>
                        We reserve the right, though not obligated, to verify certain credentials of Providers using our Services, such as confirming their good standing with their respective licensure board(s). The Providers utilizing or featured on the platform are independent practitioners operating on their own behalf and are not our employees. Any opinions, advice, or information expressed by a healthcare facility, professional, specialist, or other Provider using or featured on the platform belong solely to them and do not reflect our opinions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We do not endorse or recommend any specific tests, Providers, products, procedures, medications, devices, opinions, or other information mentioned on the platform or by any Provider or licensee of ours. We do not make any representations or warranties regarding the training or skill of any Providers who offer services via the platform. You will receive a list of available providers located in the U.S. based solely on the information you provide to us. Ultimately, you are responsible for selecting your specific Provider. The inclusion of Providers on the platform or in any professional directory on the platform does not imply recommendation or endorsement, nor is it intended as a means of verifying the credentials, qualifications, or abilities of any Provider listed therein.
                    </p>
                    <p>Any medical advice provided to you by a Provider through the Services is based on your personal health data as provided by you to the Provider and local standards of care for your presenting symptoms, as determined by the information you provide.</p>

                    <p>Patients may need to provide certain Personal Information, such as their name, date of birth, gender, address, email, mobile and work phone numbers, along with a user ID and password. Additionally, patients have the option to provide additional information, such as middle name or initial, home phone number, other contact information, pharmacy details, picture, and communication preferences. During a video consultation via the Services, patients can also share other health-related information with the Provider. Patient medication history refers to a record of prescriptions prescribed by healthcare providers. This history is compiled from various sources, including pharmacies and health insurers. By using the Services, you consent to allow your Provider to access your medication history for the purpose of providing care. Optional information is not mandatory for account registration but may enhance your experience on the Site or its Services.</p>
                    <p>The use of the Service to verify Provider credentials by any entity or individual is strictly prohibited.</p>

                    <p>To fulfill our obligations and process the services for you, Chalice Health may share your personally identifiable information with our authorized service providers who perform specific services or functions on our behalf. Chalice Health may also be obligated by law to disclose the information you provide while using any of the services on the Site.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine. Any obligation to indemnify an Indemnitee for any loss, liability, or expense arising from any negligent, grossly negligent, reckless, willful, fraudulent, or intentional conduct committed by any Indemnitee may not be enforceable against any visitor of the Services to the extent applicable law requires, such as from certain jurisdictions (such as from New Jersey).</p>

This applies even if Chalice Health has been advised of the possibility of such damages, whether arising from contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise. Such damages may result from: (I) your use or inability to use the service; (II) the procurement of substitute goods or services due to goods, data, information, or services obtained through the service; (III) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (IV) statements or conduct of any third party on the service, including providers; or (V) any other matter relating to the service.</p>
                    <p>In no event shall Chalice Health's total liability to you for all damages, losses, or causes of action exceed the amount you have paid to Chalice Health in the past six (6) months, or one hundred dollars ($100), whichever is greater.</p>

                    <p>Some jurisdictions do not permit the disclaimer or exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Therefore, some of the above limitations may not apply to you or may not be enforceable in your jurisdiction. If you are dissatisfied with any part of the service or these terms of service, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue use of the service.</p>
                    <p>For users from New Jersey, the aforementioned sections titled "Indemnification and Release," "Disclaimer of Warranties," and "Limitation of Liability" are intended to be as broad as permitted under the laws of the State of New Jersey.

                    <h3>15. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration:</h3>
                    <p> <strong>15.1. Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to your use of the Chalice Health marketplace platform ("Platform"), including but not limited to the validity, interpretation, enforceability, or breach of these Terms of Service, shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the Nebraska Uniform Arbitration Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 25-2601 et seq., and the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in effect, except as modified by this agreement.</p>
                    <p> <strong>15.2. Arbitration Procedures: </strong>The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language and shall take place in Omaha, Nebraska, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The arbitration shall be conducted on an individual basis, and not as a class, consolidated, or representative action. Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p>

                    <p> <strong>15.3. Opt-Out: </strong>You may opt-out of this arbitration provision within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms of Service by sending a written notice to Chalice Health at <a href="mailto:support@chalicehealth.com">support&#64;chalicehealth.com</a> . Your written notice must include your name, address, username, email address used to register with the Platform, and a statement that you are opting out of the arbitration provision. If you opt-out, you and Chalice Health agree to resolve disputes in accordance with Section [insert section number for alternative dispute resolution mechanism, if applicable].</p>
                    <p><strong>15.4. Class Action Waiver: </strong>You and Chalice Health agree that any arbitration shall be conducted on an individual basis and not as a class, consolidated, or representative action. You and Chalice Health expressly waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.</p>
                    <p><strong>15.5. Governing Law:  </strong>These Terms of Service and any dispute arising out of or related to them shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nebraska, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
                    <p><strong>15.6. Severability:  </strong>If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
